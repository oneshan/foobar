## Languages & Constrains

### Python

To provide a Python solution, edit solution.py

Your code will run inside a Python 2.7.6 sandbox.
Standard libraries are supported except for bz2, crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, signal, termios, thread, time, unicodedata, zipimport, zlib.

### Java

To provide a Java solution, edit solution.java

Your code will be compiled using standard Java 7. It must implement the answer() method in the solution stub.
Execution time is limited. Some classes are restricted (e.g. java.lang.ClassLoader). You will see a notice if you use a restricted class when you verify your solution.
Third-party libraries, input/output operations, spawning threads or processes and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.
